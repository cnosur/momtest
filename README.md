## Make Or Miss 

### "It's a Make or Miss League"


Make or Miss is data visualization project based on the 2018-2019 NBA Season. For this project we have chosen to take a look at games that were decided by three points our less and therefore could have changed the outcome based on the final shot. Explore how standings could have differed, potential wins for that season, the correlation between time left and distance of shot, team efficiency during these parameters, and all the what ifs that come with it.


Web Application built in React


Data was sourced from ESPN Advanced Stats and Basketball Reference.


Visuals were made with D3.js.


Dedicated to Rachel Nichols and ESPN’s The Jump


Created by Brian Ford and Leonardo Silva - University of Denver Full Stack Web Development Graduates

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
